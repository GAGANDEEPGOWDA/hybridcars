<h2>WHAT IS HYBRID TECHNOLOGY IN CARS?</h2>
<p>hybrid electric vehicle uses a gasoline engine and an electric motor. <br> The vehicle can be driven using its electric power alone, as well as with the engine and electric motor working together.</p>
<br>
<img src="https://toyota.com.ph/img/hybrid/engine-image.png" alt="engine and motor of hybrid cars" width="1000" >
<br>
<br>
Sometimes the electric motor does all the work, sometimes it's the gas engine, and sometimes they work together. <br> The result is less gasoline burned and, therefore, better fuel economy. <br> Adding electric power can even boost performance in certain instances.

<h2>HISTORY OF HYBRID CARS</h2>
<p>The first hybrid car was built in the year 1899 by engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Porsche">Ferdinand Porsche</a>.  </p>
<br>
<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DZTAxubVQAELV7s.jpg:large" alt="1st hybrid car" width="30%">
<br>
<p> He used a gasoline engine to supply power to an electric motor that drove the car's front wheels. <br> The Mixte was well-received, and over 300 were produced. </p>
<br>
<p>The demand for hybrids began to wane, however, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford#:~:text=Henry%20Ford%20(July%2030%2C%201863,line%20technique%20of%20mass%20production.">Henry Ford</a> started the first automobile assembly line in 1904. Ford's ability to produce gasoline-powered cars and offer them at low prices dramatically shrunk the hybrid vehicle market.</p>
<br>

<sub> [ ABOVE IS THE IMAGE OF HENRY FORD ]</sub>
<br>
<br>

<p>Most  hybrids sold poorly because they had higher prices and less power than their gasoline-powered counterparts. Hybrids soon became a thing of the past.</p>

<br>
<h5>WHEN THE GOVERNMENT STARTED TO SUPPORT AUTO MANUFACTURERS TO PRODUCE HYBRIDS</h5>
<p>Over the next 25 years, auto manufacturers spent billions of dollars on the research and development of hybrid technologies. </p>
<p>In 1999, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Insight">Honda Insight</a>  became the first mass-production HEV released in the United States. </p>
<br>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/2010_Honda_Insight_LX_--_10-03-2009.jpg/420px-2010_Honda_Insight_LX_--_10-03-2009.jpg" alt="honda insight car" width="40%">
<br>
<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Prius">Toyota Prius</a> sedan, released in the United States in 2000, that gave hybrid technology the foothold it was looking for. <br> In the years since its United States introduction, <br> the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=award+for+the+best+hybrid+car&rlz=1C1FKPE_enIN1033IN1035&oq=award+for+the+best+hybrid+car&aqs=chrome..69i57j33i10i160l3j33i22i29i30l6.7717j0j15&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Prius has became synonymous with the term "Hybrid"</a> . It is the most popular HEV ever produced, and auto manufacturers around the world.</p>

<h2>DOES WE REALLY NEED TO CHARGE THIS HYBRID CAR?</h2>

<p>hybrid cars are self-charging. Electricity is generated as you drive the car, captured from the energy created when you brake or slow down.</p>
<p>Hybrids also use the gas engine to charge and maintain the battery. </p>
<p> A hybrid electric vehicle cannot be plugged in to charge the battery. Instead, the battery is charged through regenerative braking and by the internal combustion engine.</p>


</center>


<center>

 <h2>HOW THE BATTERY GET CHARGED IN HYBRID CARS?</h2>
 <p> The battery is charged through regenerative braking and by the internal combustion engine.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <h3>WHAT IS THIS "REGENERATIVE BREAKING SYSTEM" AND HOW IT WORKS ?</h3>
 <p>This is one of the best features found in hybrid cars. <br> Regenerative braking allows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy">kinetic energy</a> to convert into electric energy that recharges the battery unit.</p>
 <p>The engine in reverse mode is run by a forward movement of the vehicle's wheels. This helps reduce the car's speed and recharge at the same time.</p>
 <br>
 <img src="https://i.makeagif.com/media/5-13-2015/sSPWBP.gif" alt="regenerative breaking system" width="40%">
 <br>

 <p>In the vast majority of these cars, the transmission of the car is set up such that when the driver applies the brakes,
 <br> the electric motor reverses itself and applies a resistance to the wheels rather than power. <br> The resistance applied to the wheels is then put through the electric motor where it is used to recharge the batteries.</p>

<h2> WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF HYBRID HYBRID CARS? </h2>
<br>

 <b> Mild Hybrids </b> <br>
 Mild hybrid is one of the newest innovations in hybrid technology. <br> The mild hybrid system provides a slight boost to the vehicle's gasoline engine, usually when the car is accelerated from a dead stop. </li>
 <br>
 <br>
 <b> Full Hybrids </b> <br>
    Full hybrids sport both electrical components and a gasoline engine. <br> However, the electric component in hybrid cars can handle more workload than that in a mild hybrid.</li>
  <br> 
  <br>
  <b> Again this full Hybrids is of 2 types</b>
  <br>
  <P> <u> PARALLEL HYBRIDS </u> - accelerate, sound, and feel are the gasoline engine's </P>
  <p> <u> SERIES HYBRIDS </u> - Here, the driving experience is more like an electric car since an electric motor is the sole source of power.</p>
  <p>The gasoline engine is present in this mode only to charge its battery.</p>
